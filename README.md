# Admin - Dashboard

## 2nd project of TOP's Full Stack JavaScript Path

This is my "No-Flex-Box-At-All"-Solution

+ Even the "Grid Logo" is grid

  and of course it is a button to collapse the navbar

+ I used the "Space Grotesk" font from google fonts

  <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk?query=space>

+ and the icon set is "Phosphor"

  <https://phosphoricons.com>

+ I gave this one a bit of responsiveness, hope it'll work.

This project was predestined to present my previous projects for TOP and so I did. It also will be good for the upcoming projects.

I'm quite happy with my work, although it is truly expandable - keyword: accessibility...

I really hope you like the design.

I'm always in doubt about the quality of my English - maybe it's good for a few laughs?
